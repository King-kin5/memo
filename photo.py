        I need to evaluate if "{place_name}" is photo-worthy for Snapchat, focusing ONLY on entertainment, self-enjoyment, or creating memories.
        
        Here's information I found about this place:
        {place_info}
        
        Based on this information, follow these steps:
        1. Identify what type of place this is (beach, museum, restaurant, landmark, etc.).
        2. Determine if this place is likely a good spot for photos that are fun, entertaining, or memory-worthy.
        3. If it IS photo-worthy, suggest:
           - 3 specific Snapchat themes or filters that would work well there based on the type of place
           - What specific elements to focus on in photos
           - Best type of shots (selfies, panoramas, close-ups, etc.)
           - Creative caption ideas for sharing
        4. If it is NOT photo-worthy for entertainment/enjoyment/memories/, explain briefly why in a single sentence.
        Important guidelines:
        - Focus ONLY on entertainment value, fun factor, and memory creation
        - Keep your response concise and enthusiastic (use emojis!)
        - Be specific to this exact location and its characteristics, not generic
        - Prioritize uniqueness and "shareability" on social media
